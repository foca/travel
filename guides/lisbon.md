# Foca's Guide to Lisbon

## Food, snacks, and sweets

* [Solar 31 da Calçada][solar-31]

  Amazing seafood. Get the octopus with shrimp.

* [Carvoaria Jacto][carvoaria]

  Steak. The dry aged steak was phenomenal. Also their appetizer tray has some
  good options.

* [Bairro do Avillez][bairro-avillez]

  Fantastic "modern" Portuguese by chef José Avillez (of Belcanto fame.) A bit
  more upscale. Good wine selection. Everything is small plates to share. The
  pork skin "popcorn", the exploding olives, and the octopus in kimchi sauce
  were all fantastic.

* [Pistola y Corazón][tacos]

  Tacos. All of them. Really. Also amazing cocktails. Delicious Mexican
  (Mexican, not Texan or Californian) food. And did I mention the cocktails?

* [Manteigaria][]

  The best pasteis de nata in Lisbon, bar none. Open until midnight, perfect to
  get one (or seven) right before going to bed. Or for breakfast. Or really, at
  any time during the day.

* [Mini Bar][minibar]

  Another one by José Avillez. Get the "surprise" 7-course tasting menu and
  enjoy all the different flavors. I won't spoil the surprise here. Also,
  amazing cocktails.

* [Damas][]

  Trendy restaurant/bar. Food was great, but I can't remember what I got.
  Definitely some form of fish.

* [Jardim dos Sentidos][jardim-dos-sentidos]

  Pretty good veggie and vegan food. The Chili, the Thai soup, and the four
  cheese pasta. You can also get a massage in the back, but I haven't tried this
  yet.

* [Gelato Davvero][davvero]

  Amazing gelato with interesting flavors. Basil was probably my favorite. Also
  worth of note are avocado and ricotta with nuts and honey. But really,
  everything I had was pretty fucking good.

### [TimeOut Market][timeout-market]

This large market hall has plenty of options. It's hard to find seating space
for larger groups (unless you go very early or late.) Officially open until 1am,
but some places close at midnight. Still, great for a late-ish snack.

Order one thing at one place and while you wait go order in a different place.
Some of my personal favorites:

* [Tartar-Ia][tartar-ia]

  A bunch of different forms of tartare. Personal favorites were the classic
  boeuf tartare, the "asian-style beef tartare" (with sweet chili), and the tuna
  and avocado tartare.

* [Sea Me][sea-me]

  Pretty good seafood. The sardine nigiri and the scallops were probably my
  favorites.

* [Croqueteria][]

  All the croquetas you can stuff in your face. My faves are the "tradicional"
  (beef), "caça" (boar sausage), and "queijo" (cheese).

* [Manteigaria][manteigaria-mercado]

  The best pasteis de nata have a second location in the market. So you don't
  have to climb the hill after all the yummy food to get that pastei.
